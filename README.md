# Our program asks the user for their name and age. It prints out if they can drive if they are 16 and older. If they are not 16 years old, the program says they are unable to drive. 

# In order to use our software, you must make a git clone of it through github. To use it, one must enter their name and age. Once this is done, the rest is done for the user. 

# INSTALLATION
# Go to github. Click the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS URL. Then in JupyterHub, type in "git clone " + URL. 

# How to Contribute
# Make sure to ask the owner for permission to fork the code. Then make sure to communicate with the owner by using pull requests and adding to the program accordingly.
